These are codes from outside the chemistry domain which\r\nexercise specific features of the X10 language.\r\n\r\n## Compiling\r\n\r\n    $ ant\r\n\r\nwill build and test the major application codes in ANUChem (fmm, pme and\r\npumjarasaayani).\r\n\r\nEach application or sample subdirectory also has either an Ant build script or\r\na Makefile.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Working with ANUChem\r\n\r\nThe codes are under continuous revision and the current source is available in the [ANUChem Github project](https://github.com/milthorpe/anuchem).\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are source distributions containing \"release\" versions of the source code that compile against each released version of X10.\r\n\r\nFor any questions about building, testing or extending ANUChem, please email josh.milthorpe@anu.edu.au\r\n\r\nANUChem is free software under the Eclipse Public License.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Referencing ANUChem\r\n\r\nPlease cite the following paper when referencing ANUChem in a publication.\r\n\r\nJ.
