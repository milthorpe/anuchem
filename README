ANUChem computational chemistry suite

Overview:
------------

ANUChem is a suite of computational chemistry codes written in the X10
programming language.
http://x10.codehaus.org/

It is intended to test the expressiveness, performance and scalability of X10
for use in developing scientific application codes.

ANUChem currently contains three significant application codes:

- pumjarasaayani (Quantum Chemistry): solves the molecular electronic structure
  problem using the Hartree-Fock/self-consistent field method.
- fmm (PGAS-FMM): calculates the electrostatic potential of a system of charged
  particles using the Fast Multipole Method.
- pme (Particle Mesh Ewald): calculates electrostatic potential using the
  Smooth Particle Mesh Ewald method.

The individual codes are described in ${appname}/doc/README including the build
process and test inputs.

In addition, there are a number of smaller codes contained in ./samples and
./microbenchmarks.  These are codes from outside the chemistry domain which
exercise specific features of the X10 language.

Compiling:
----------

$ ant

will build and test the major application codes in ANUChem (fmm, pme and
pumjarasaayani).

Each application or sample subdirectory also has either an Ant build script or
a Makefile.


Working with ANUChem:
-----------------------------

The codes are under continuous revision and the current source is available at
http://sourceforge.net/p/anuchem/code

In addition, there are source distributions containing tagged "release" versions
of the source code that compile against each released version of X10.

For any questions about building, testing or extending ANUChem, please email

ANUChem is free software under the Eclipse Public License.
