ANUChem computational chemistry suite

This program is controlled by the Eclipse Public Licence v1.0 http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html

Overview:
------------

ANUChem is a suite of codes written in the X10 programming language.
http://x10.codehaus.org/

It is intended to test the expressiveness, performance and scalability of X10 for use in developing scientific application codes.

ANUChem currently comprises three codes:

pumjarasaayani (Quantum Chemistry): solves the molecular electronic structure problem using the Hartree-Fock/self-consistent field method.
fmm (Fast Multipole Method): calculates the electrostatic potential of a system of charged particles using the Fast Multipole Method.
pme (Particle Mesh Ewald): calculates electrostatic potential using the Smooth Particle Mesh Ewald method.

The individual codes are described in ${appname}/doc/README including the build process and test inputs.


Working with ANUChem:
-----------------------------

The codes are under continuous revision and the current source is available at http://squirrel.anu.edu.au/hg/public/x10-apps/

In addition, there are tagged "release" versions of the source that compile against each released version of X10.  See http://squirrel.anu.edu.au/hg/public/x10-apps/tags

For any questions about building, testing or extending ANUChem, please email josh.milthorpe@anu.edu.au

ANUChem is free software under the Eclipse Public License.
