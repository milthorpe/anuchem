Introduction
------------

This example code performs a two-dimensional lattice Boltzmann simulation of
flow in a lid-driven square cavity.

J. Milthorpe and A.P. Rendell (2012). Efficient update of ghost regions using
active messages (preprint), in proceedings of the 19th IEEE International
Conference on High Performance Computing (HiPC). 

Dependencies
------------
This example requires the addition of ghost region support to the X10 array
library, as described in Milthorpe and Rendell (2012).  See ghostRegions.patch
