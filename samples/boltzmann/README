Lattice-Boltzmann example code, part of ANU-Chem

Introduction
------------

This example code performs a two-dimensional lattice Boltzmann simulation of
flow in a lid-driven square cavity. It is derived from a Fortran/GA example
code distributed with the Global Arrays library.

active messages", in proceedings of the 19th IEEE International Conference on
High Performance Computing (HiPC 2012). doi:10.1109/HiPC.2012.6507484

Dependencies
------------
X10 2.5.2 including ghost region support for X10 distributed arrays.
