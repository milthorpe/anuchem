TODOs for Fast Multipole method code

- investigate performance when using real terms in expansions instead of complex
- periodicity only in some dimensions
- generalise for non-cubic box
- generalise TriangularRegion and incorporate into X10 array library
- distributed implementation of combineMacroscopicExpansions
- adaptive tree to better handle non-uniform particle distribution
- document performance results, including "crossover point" vs. direct and PME, weak and strong scaling
- document error behaviour with regard to tree size and number of terms in expansions
- remove hand-optimised iterators from LocalExpansion, MultipoleExpansion and review performance
