TODOs for Fast Multipole method code

- investigate performance when using real terms in expansions instead of complex
- periodicity only in some dimensions
- generalise for non-cubic box
- generalise TriangularRegion and incorporate into X10 array library
- distributed implementation of combineMacroscopicExpansions
- adaptive tree to better handle non-uniform particle distribution

For Summer Scholar?

- document performance results, including "crossover point" vs. direct and PME, weak and strong scaling
- document error behaviour with regard to tree size and number of terms in expansions
- remove hand-optimised iterators from LocalExpansion, MultipoleExpansion and review performance
- use rotations for translation operator - see C.A.White and M.Head-Gordon, J. Chem. Phys. v. 105, p.5061 (1996). Rotating around the quartic angular momentum barrier in fast multipole method calculation.
