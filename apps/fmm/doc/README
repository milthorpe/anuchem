Fast Multipole Method molecular mechanics code, part of ANU-Chem

This program is controlled by the Eclipse Public Licence v1.0 http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html

Introduction:
------------

This code performs an electrostatic potential calculation using the Fast Multipole Method with analytic expansions.

The implementation basically follows White & Head-Gordon (1994), with periodic boundary conditions as per Kudin & Scuseria (1998).  Some aspects of the distributed algorithm are taken from Lashuk et al. (2009) such as the use of Locally Essential Trees.

The potential calculation by itself is not very useful; in the future we hope to incorporate it into a dynamics code.  For now, it provides an illustration of the possible use of X10 language constructs to construct a distributed tree code.

Compiling:
----------

$ ant

will build the required executable and put it in bin/periodicFmm3d

$ ant clean

will remove the executable and all intermediate C++ files.

The default build script builds against the "sockets" implementation of X10RT.
To build against the MPI implementation set property ${x10rt} to "mpi".
To build for Blue Gene set ${x10rt} to "pgas_bgp".

For other implementations see 
  http://x10-lang.org/documentation/getting-started/x10rt-implementations.html


Compile dependencies:
------------------------
* X10 version 2.2.2 (optionally with x10rt=mpi)
* XLA library (cd ~/x10-apps/x10x.lib/xla && ant)
* anu-chem library (cd ~/x10-apps/anuchem && ant)


To run:
------

Single place:

runx10 bin/fmm3d numAtoms [density] [numTerms] [wellSpaced] [-verbose] [-compare]
runx10 bin/periodicFmm3d numAtoms [density] [numTerms] [numShells] [-verbose]

Multiple place:

mpiexec -n <n> bin/fmm3d numAtoms [density] [numTerms] [wellSpaced] [-verbose] [-compare]

where <n> is number of places

- numParticles is self explanatory
- density is a "target density" for the mean number of particles per lowest-level box.  The default value is 3.0; a larger value means less levels in the tree, which gives less accurate results and shorter run time.
- numTerms is the number of terms "p" at which to truncate multipole and local expansions.  The default is 10; the larger the value, the more accurate the result and the longer the run time.
- wellSpaced is the number of intervening boxes by which a pair of boxes must be separated to be considered "well spaced".  The default is 2; the larger the value, the accurate the result and the longer the run time. 
- -verbose provides more verbose logging, including statistics of the time spent in each phase of the code
- -compare performs an additional N^2 (direct) electrostatics calculation, for the purpose of comparing performance and accuracy of the result
