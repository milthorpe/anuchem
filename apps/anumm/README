ANUMM (molecular mechanics) code, part of ANU-Chem

This program is controlled by the Eclipse Public Licence v1.0

Introduction:
------------

ANUMM is intended as a general framework for molecular dynamics simulation in
X10 that would support different integrators, force fields and particularly
different parallel methods of computing non-bonded interactions.  However, it
is currently unfinished and so is unsuitable for most simulations. 

ANUMM has been used in a complete MD simulation of ion-ion interactions in a
mass spectrometer (see test/au/edu/anu/mm/TestCyclotron.x10).

Compiling:
----------

$ ant

will build the executable bin/anumm

$ ant clean

will remove the executable and all intermediate C++ files.

The default build script builds against the "sockets" implementation of X10RT.
To build against the MPI implementation set property ${x10rt} to "mpi".
To build for Blue Gene/Q set ${bgq} to "true".

For other implementations see 
  http://x10-lang.org/documentation/getting-started/x10rt-implementations.html


Compile dependencies:
------------------------
* X10 version 2.5 (optionally with x10rt=mpi)
* XLA library (cd ~/anuchem-code/x10x.lib/xla && ant)
* anu-chem library (cd ~/anuchem-code/anuchem && ant)
* PGAS-FMM library (cd ~/anuchem-code/apps/fmm && ant buildx10lib-cpp)
* FFTW http://www.fftw.org/ 
  (header files at the location ${fftw3.include} in the ant build script)
* FFTW X10 wrapper (cd ~/anuchem-code/fftw_wrapper && ant)


To run:
------

$ bin/anumm [testfile]

e.g.

$ bin/anumm test/water10.mol
