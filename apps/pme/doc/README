(Smooth) Particle Mesh Ewald molecular mechanics code, part of ANU-Chem

This program is controlled by the Eclipse Public Licence v1.0 http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html

Introduction:
------------

This code performs an electrostatic potential calculation using the Smooth Particle Mesh Ewald method.

The implementation follows Essmann et al. (1995), with some insights regarding the 3D FFT from Oh & Deng (2007).

The potential calculation by itself is not very useful; in the future we hope to incorporate it into a dynamics code.  For now, it provides an illustration of the possible use of X10 language constructs in structured grid codes and spectral methods.

Compiling:
----------

$ ant

will build the required executable and put it in bin/pme

$ ant clean

will remove the executable and all intermediate C++ files.

The default build script builds against the "sockets" implementation of X10RT.
To build against the MPI implementation set property ${x10rt} to "mpi".
To build for Blue Gene set ${x10rt} to "pgas_bgp".

For other implementations see 
  http://x10-lang.org/documentation/getting-started/x10rt-implementations.html


Compile dependencies:
------------------------
* X10 version 2.2.2 (optionally with x10rt=mpi)
* FFTW http://www.fftw.org/ 
  (linked to at the locations ${fftw3.include} and ${fftw3.lib} in the ant build script)
* anu-chem library (cd ~/x10-apps/anuchem && ant)
* XLA library (cd ~/x10-apps/x10x.lib/xla && ant)


To run:
------

Single place:

runx10 bin/pme numAtoms [ewaldCoefficient] [cutoff] [gridSize] [splineOrder]

Multiple place:

mpiexec -n <n> bin/pme numAtoms [ewaldCoefficient] [cutoff] [gridSize] [splineOrder]

where <n> is number of places

- numAtoms is self explanatory
- ewaldCoefficient is the parameter 'Beta' which controls the tradeoff between the convergence of long-range and short-range components.  The default value is 0.35.
- cutoff is the distance in Angstroms beyond which direct evaluation of force/potential does not occur.  The default value is 10.0.
- gridSize is the number of grid points in each dimension of the (cubic) simulation cell.
- splineOrder is the number of grid points in each dimension over which charges are spread using b-spline interpolation.
For detailed explanation of all parameters, see Essman et al. (1995).
