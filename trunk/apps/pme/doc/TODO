TODOs for Particle Mesh Ewald code

- formulate distributed 3D FFT using Team allToAll
- faster grid interpolation - investigate using tables (as per GROMACS?)
- non-cubic unit cell
- generalise ghost cell solution (in scatterAndReduceShiftedGridContribution) and incorporate into X10 array library (XTENLANG-1365)

For Summer Scholar ?
- document performance results, including "crossover point" vs. direct and FMM, weak and strong scaling
- document error behaviour with regard to tree size and number of terms in expansions
- use real data DFTs (from FFTW) instead of complex data, to speed up FFT
